This project aims to classify customer reviews into two categories: "Positive" and "Negative" sentiment, using a machine learning approach. The task is to predict whether a given review expresses a positive or negative sentiment about a product. The project involves using a small, custom dataset with 200 product reviews, along with text preprocessing techniques to clean the data, followed by applying a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment prediction.
